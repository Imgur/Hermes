**Hermes is a simple and robust in-app notification system for iOS written in Swift.**  It supports posting Notifications with styled or unstyled text, an icon, sound, color, and an action closure.  You can easily build your own notification template and add any number of attributes and features to a HermesNotification.

Hermes shows all queued up notifications at once, with an easy way to swipe through them (and will animate through them automatically if you don't touch any notifications for 3 seconds)

##Installation
###Cocoapods Installation
Hermes is available on CocoaPods. Just add the following to your project Podfile:

```
pod 'Hermes', '~> 1.0'
```

###Non-Cocoapods Installation
You can drop Hermes' files directly into your project, or drag the Hermes project into your workspace.

###Usage
Import in **Swift**
```swift
import Hermes
```
or **Objective-C**
```objective-c
#import <Hermes/Hermes.h>
```

##Getting Started
###Components
- **Hermes** (public)

  You will use Hermes.sharedInstance to post Notifications.  You can tell Hermes when to *wait()* and collect notifications and when to *go()* and post notifications as soon as Hermes has any.
  
- **Notification** (public, extendable)

  A Notification is a model that has attributes like text, image, sound, and color. You can extend or subclass Notifications and use them in custom NotificationViews
  
- **NotificationView** (public, extendable)

  A NotificationView is a UIView that displays Notifications.  Hermes lets you subclass and display your own NotificationViews that match your app's style.
  
- **BulletinView** (protected)

  The BulletinView is a UIView that shows 1 or many NotificationViews. Hermes does not let you subclass and use your own BulletinView.

###How to use 
*In two easy steps!*

1. Make one or many Notifications
2. ```hermes.postNotifications([...])```

###Sample code

**Creating Notifications**
```swift
// uses Hermes singleton
let hermes = Hermes.sharedInstance

// 'Upload Complete!' success Notification
let successNotification = HermesNotification()
successNotification.text = "Upload complete!"
successNotification.image = UIImage(named: "success_icon")
successNotification.color = .greenColor()

// Call self.foo() when the NotificationView for this Notification is tapped
successNotification.action = { notification in
    self.foo() 
}

// 'Upload failed :(' failure Notification
let failureNotification = HermesNotification()
failureNotification.text = "Upload failed :("
failureNotification.image = UIImage(named: "error_icon")
failureNotification.color = .redColor()
```

### Posting Notifications

#####If you post Notifications while a Bulletin is already showing, it will show all of the new Notifications after the current Bulletin closes
```swift
hermes.postNotification(successNotification)
hermes.postNotification(failureNotification)
```

#####You can tell Hermes to wait and go, to collect a bunch of notifications before showing them 
```swift
// we could do use wait(), which tells Hermes to collect notifications without showing them yet
hermes.wait()

// post both the success and failure notification 
hermes.postNotification(successNotification)
hermes.postNotification(failureNotification)

// this tells Hermes to post all of the notifications in the queue
hermes.go()
```

#####Or, you can post an array of notifications that Hermes will show immediately
```swift
// we could have also done the above code by simply using postNotifications
hermes.postNotifications([successNotification, failureNotification])
```

It's that easy!

###Subclassing HermesNotificationView
Subclassing HermesNotificationView is very easy, and gives you the freedom to make the view as simple or complicated as you want.
```swift
class CustomNotificationView: HermesNotificationView {
  override var notification: HermesNotification? {
    didSet {
      // update your view
    }
  }
}
```

Next you need is to implement the HermesDelegate like this:
```swift
hermes.delegate = self
```

And the delegate method:
```swift
func hermesNotificationViewForNotification(#hermes: Hermes, notification: HermesNotification) -> HermesNotificationView? {
        if notification.tag == kCustomNotificationTag {
            return CustomNotificationView()
        }
        return nil
    }
```
You can tag HermesNotifications to help with determining which custom HermesNotificationView to use, or just always return your custom notification view. This is up to you!
